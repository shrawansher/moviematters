# moviematters v1.0

### The Inspiration:
A simple excel spreadsheet maintained manually by a movie enthusiast (Shrawan Sher) since 2003, that contains movie titles and personal ratings from 0-10 for over 780 movies. 

### Need for a tool !
As a cinephile, I want...

1. To understand my personal preferences in movies, and uncover hidden patterns.
2. To help recommmend movies I've viewed and rated to others.

We built a simple visualization tool to do just that.
Check it out!

### How to use the tool?
1. Use the filters to drill down based on  year of release, genres, personal rating, runtime. 
1. Scroll between an aggregated view of movies watched and rating plots with individual movies. 
1. Click on any bar to look at the ratings only for that year.
1. A movie is underrated, if you personally rate it signifcantly higher than IMDB. We classified a movie as underrrated or overrated based on a statistically significant difference between the personal and IMDB ratings (p= 0.05)
